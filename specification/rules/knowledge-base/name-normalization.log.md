- field: statement
  unstated: The material says entity resolution compares normalized names without saying what normalizing does.
  decided: Lower-casing, removing accents, trimming and collapsing inner whitespace.
  why: The material names the normalization as the database's own, and one normalization for every name comparison keeps resolution and alias matching from disagreeing about the same name.
