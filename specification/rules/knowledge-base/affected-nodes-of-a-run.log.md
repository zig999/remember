- field: statement
  unstated: The material collects a run's affected nodes from the nodes its link and attribute proposals join or describe on the directed path, while the extraction path and a rebuild from tool calls count only the nodes its node proposals resolved to; the two decide differently for the target node of a link an extraction accepted.
  decided: The nodes that landed link and attribute proposals join or describe are affected nodes on every path.
  why: The collector is built to take those nodes, and only the extraction's results fail to carry them.
- field: consistency
  unstated: The material does not say how this read holds across the separate records it combines.
  decided: eventual
  why: The records it combines are written independently and never change in one transaction, so a read reflects each as last committed.
