- field: statement
  unstated: The material has an MCP proposal whose service answered a refusal without raising it return that refusal wrapped in a success, while REST returns the refusal itself.
  decided: The two transports carry the same result and the same error code for every ingestion operation both expose, so MCP answers such a refusal as a refusal.
  why: Nothing in the material makes the ingestion transports differ in what they answer, only in how they frame it.
