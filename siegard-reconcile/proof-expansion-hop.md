title: Query-retrieval search service re-read with the expansion-hop test as its proof
summary: The test that proves the expansion hop rule changed since it was certified; the owner offers
  the same test as it now stands, and this reconciliation asks whether the rule still holds in the search
  service and whether that test would fail if it stopped holding.
target: backend
files:
- path: src/modules/query-retrieval/service/search.service.ts
  change: Keeps the hop the traversal gave each reached link, counting a link that touches the matched
    node as hop 1.
nodes:
- node: rules/knowledge-base/expansion-hop
  conforms: true
  how: "src/modules/query-retrieval/service/search.service.ts: held at collectExpandedLinks, the loop\
    \ over traversal.links, where each reached link is recorded with the hop that traverseNodes assigned\
    \ it. buildExpandedLinkItems then copies that hop into the item's hop field through toExpandedLinkItem.\
    \ — for (const link of traversal.links) {\n  keepBestPath(reached, {\n    link,\n    hop: link.hop,\n\
    \    score: Math.pow(TRAVERSAL_DECAY, link.hop) * startScore,\n  });\n}\nand in toExpandedLinkItem:\
    \ `const { link, hop, score } = candidate;` ... `score, hop,`. The count itself is made in traverseNodes,\
    \ in backend/src/modules/knowledge-graph/service/traversal.service.ts: `for (let hop = 1; hop <= input.depth;\
    \ hop += 1) {` ... `const score = Math.pow(TRAVERSAL_DECAY, hop);`. That count starts at 1 for links\
    \ next to the matched node and adds one per link along the path. This file keeps that value and invents\
    \ no other count. Matched nodes themselves are items with `hop: 0`, which is not a link hop."
