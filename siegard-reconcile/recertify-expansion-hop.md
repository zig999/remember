title: Recertify expansion-hop after its proof file gained tests
summary: search.service.ts did not change; the proof file search-service-expansion.spec.ts gained tests
  in the review-proofs initiative, so the certification of rules/knowledge-base/expansion-hop is offered
  again against the test as it now stands.
target: backend
files:
- path: src/modules/query-retrieval/service/search.service.ts
  change: unchanged; the certification of expansion-hop is re-read against the proof file as it now stands.
nodes:
- node: rules/knowledge-base/expansion-hop
  conforms: false
  how: 'no named file holds this fact now: src/modules/query-retrieval/service/search.service.ts read
    `nowhere` — This file does not count hops. It takes the hop from the traversal''s result and forwards
    it: `score: Math.pow(TRAVERSAL_DECAY, link.hop) * startScore,` and `for (const link of traversal.links)
    { keepBestPath(reached, { link, hop: link.hop, ...`. The count itself, starting at 1 for a link next
    to the start node, is made in another file, backend/src/modules/knowledge-graph/service/traversal.service.ts:
    `for (let hop = 1; hop <= input.depth; hop += 1) {` ... `hop,` ... `score,`. A change to how a link''s
    hop is counted would reach that file, not this one.'

notes: 'Judged by 1 delegation(s), one per file; folded mechanically by trace.py --fold from the returns
  under siegard-reconcile/recertify-expansion-hop.returns/.

  Certification of rules/knowledge-base/expansion-hop held (src/__tests__/unit/query-retrieval/search-service-expansion.spec.ts
  would fail if the fact stopped holding) and is not written: the judgment did not clear the node, and
  a test-decided binding rests on a reading that did.

  Candidates: 0 opened across 0 of 1 delegation(s); each return lists its own under `candidates_opened`.'
