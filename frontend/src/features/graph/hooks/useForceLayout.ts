/**
 * useForceLayout — d3-force subgraph layout with pin of existing nodes (TC-FE-05).
 *
 * Reads the live `nodes` / `links` Maps from `useGraphStore`, runs a synchronous
 * d3-force simulation, and writes the computed `{x, y}` positions back into the
 * store's `positions` Map. Returns the same Map so `GraphCanvas` can read it.
 *
 * Spec references:
 *  - temp/chat-graphspace-plan.md Rev. 2026-06-21 §5 D5 (d3-force with pin of
 *    existing nodes), §6.1 (hooks tree), §6.4 (positions Map).
 *  - docs/specs/front/components/GraphSpace.component.spec.md v1.0.0 §1
 *    ("pin existing node positions"), §5 (BDD Scenario 4 — "existing nodes do
 *    not jump"), §7 AC-F.12 (pin invariant).
 *
 * Invariants pinned here:
 *  - D5 / AC-F.12 — **nodes that already have a position in the store are
 *    pinned via `fx`/`fy`**. After the simulation runs, their `x`/`y` are
 *    snapped back to the pinned values by d3-force on every tick. New nodes
 *    receive freshly computed positions from the force field.
 *  - The hook is **headless** — no import of `@xyflow/react`. It only reads
 *    primitive `id`s and writes primitive `{x, y}` pairs. React Flow consumes
 *    the positions Map via `GraphCanvas`.
 *  - **Re-affirmation consolidates** (project principle) — a node that arrives
 *    again with the same id already has a position, so it gets pinned, and
 *    the d3-force pass leaves it exactly where it was. No layout jump.
 *  - **No animated simulation.** d3-force's internal timer is stopped
 *    immediately; we run `SIM_TICKS` ticks synchronously inside the effect
 *    so the positions are ready before the next render. Animating the
 *    simulation across frames would burn CPU on a panel that doesn't need
 *    a "physical settle" feel.
 *
 * Why this seam (not a top-level effect in GraphSpace):
 *  - The simulation depends on the live `nodes` / `links` Maps owned by the
 *    store (single writer — D2). The hook is the bridge between that store
 *    and React Flow positions; GraphSpace stays a thin orchestrator that
 *    consumes both.
 *  - Pure d3-force computation here means it is unit-testable without a DOM
 *    (jsdom is enough — no React Flow / canvas needed).
 *
 * Tailwind v4 note:
 *  - Coordinates are runtime numeric values that flow into React Flow's
 *    `position={{x,y}}` prop. They are NOT styled via utility classes —
 *    there is no "Tailwind arbitrary value" question for layout coordinates.
